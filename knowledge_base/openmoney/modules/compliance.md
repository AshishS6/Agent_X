**Without reconciliation, compliance data is provisional and may be inaccurate.**

## Common Misinterpretations

### Misinterpretation 1: IRN Generated = Compliant

**Wrong:** "IRN is generated, so invoice is compliant."

**Correct:** "IRN is generated by IRP. Verify IRN validity and ensure all compliance requirements are met."

### Misinterpretation 2: e-Way Bill Generated = Compliant

**Wrong:** "e-Way Bill is generated, so goods movement is compliant."

**Correct:** "e-Way Bill is generated by portal. Verify e-Way Bill validity and ensure all compliance requirements are met."

### Misinterpretation 3: Open Money = Compliance Authority

**Wrong:** "Open Money shows compliant, so it's compliant."

**Correct:** "Open Money facilitates compliance. Verify with tax authorities to confirm compliance."

## Compliance Authority

**Compliance data is owned by:**
- Government (IRP) — IRN generation
- Government (e-Way Bill portal) — e-Way Bill generation
- Tax authorities — Compliance verification

**Open Money does NOT own compliance data. It facilitates compliance but does not guarantee it.**
